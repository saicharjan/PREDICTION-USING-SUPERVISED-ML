Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning
This project was created as part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation in November 2022. The goal was to predict student scores based on the number of hours they studied using supervised learning techniques.

Objective
The main objective was to use machine learning to build a simple and accurate prediction model that demonstrates the relationship between study hours and student performance.

Highlights
Data Analysis: Explored and visualized the data to identify trends and patterns.
Model Training: Built and trained a Linear Regression model for predictions.
Performance Evaluation: Measured accuracy and fine-tuned the model for better results.
Tools & Technologies
Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.
A dataset containing hours of study and corresponding student scores.
How It Works
Data Preparation: Cleaned and formatted the dataset for training.
Visualization: Plotted the data to observe the correlation between study hours and scores.
Model Training: Used Linear Regression to train the model and predict scores.
Model Testing: Evaluated predictions using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Results
Created a regression line that shows the relationship between study hours and scores.
Achieved accurate predictions with minimal error.
Future Improvements
Add more features (e.g., student habits, sleep hours) to improve accuracy.
Experiment with other algorithms like Decision Trees or Random Forests.
